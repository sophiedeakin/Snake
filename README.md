# Introduction 

The Snake game is a web-based game inspired by the popular classic game called "Snake", where players move the snake's head around the board to eat the fruit, and the snake's body progressively gets longer. Every fruit that is eaten counts towards their score. Snake regained its popularity in 1997 when Taneli Armanto programmed the game to be published by Nokia for their monochrome phones. It was first introduced on the Nokia 6110. 

The website comprises a single page which includes the logo, the game board with the user's current score and high scores, and the button controls for mobile and tablet users.

## Strategy 

When thinking of the strategy of the game I considered who are the target audience and what features the users would be looking for. For the target audience, I did some research on arcade-style games and what kind of players are attracted to playing them, during my research I found easy-to-play games are more appealing to casual gamers. Casual gamers are players who play games to pass the time, be entertained, and may not care about the genre of the game. The most important research I found that shaped the way I am designing the game is smartphones are popularly used to play casual games and 18-35-year-olds with an even gender split of 50% Males and 50% Females play causal games on their phones, it's because they are relatively easy to pick up and addicting. Finally, for the features users would be looking for I found information on how to design an arcade game to make it appealing to the target audience, for example, it should have beautiful art, a simple layout, nice colours, and fonts that are easy to read.

After conducting the research I have created a list of areas to focus on in order to reach the target audience and add features that users are looking for. 

Here's the list starting from the most important: 
1. Responsiveness: After learning smartphones are widely used to play casual games, my primary focus is making sure when coding the game it responds to different mobile phone sizes. To help me with this area I will be using Device Mode in Google Developer Tools, this feature simulates various mobile devices and allows you to see how your page looks and performs.
